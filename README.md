## Introduction
This code Kata is an extended version of https://github.com/arolla/Craft_Your_Skills/tree/master/FooBarQix
## DIY
1. Read this week's task
2. Choose your programming language 
3. Choose testing framework
4. Start by creating Unit tests
5. Watch as tests fail
6. Write an implementation
7. Happily watch as all tests pass
8. Refactor code
9. Retest
10. Get 100% (or close) Code Coverage
11. Move to next week

After finishing all weeks, make a pull request which contains all tests and implementation.

## Let's Begin
Hello,
Welcome in our brand new startup where everything has to be done !

"Week 1" :
We just got some cash to implement a big part of our first feature.
We need you to implement a service (we will let aside the Rest/web service side of it).
It will take a number (positive integer) and provide :
- "Foo" if this number is multiple of 3
- "Bar" if this number is multiple of 5

If number have several multiples, they appear in natural order (Foo, Bar).

We will return the given number as a string if there is no transformation to do.

Once this step is complete, read and do [week 2](week_2.md).
